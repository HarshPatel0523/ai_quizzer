## Tech Stack

*   **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
*   **Database:** MongoDB (with Mongoose ODM)
*   **AI Integration:** Groq API
*   **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
*   **Containerization:** Docker

## Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v16 or higher recommended)
*   npm (comes with Node.js)
*   MongoDB (local instance or a MongoDB Atlas account)
*   Groq API Key (from [GroqCloud](https://groq.com/))
*   Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. Copy the contents from `.env.example` (if provided) or use the template below and fill in your actual credentials.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```env
PORT=3000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string # e.g., mongodb://localhost:27017/ai_quizzer_db or Atlas URI
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_and_long_jwt_key # Choose a strong, random string
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_from_groq_dashboard
```
**Important:** Ensure `JWT_SECRET` is a strong, unique key. Do NOT commit your `.env` file to version control.

## Running the Application

*   **Development Mode (with Nodemon for auto-restarts):**
    ```bash
    npm run dev

The application will start on the port specified in your `.env` file (default: 3000).
Access it at `http://localhost:3000`.

        *   `hint` (String, optional)
    *   `createdByAiTool` (String)
    *   `createdAt` (Date)
*   **QuizSubmission:**
    *   `studentId` (String, required - username from JWT)

## Bonus Functionalities

*   **Hints:** Integrated via `GET /api/quizzes/:quizId/questions/:questionId/hint`.
*   **Email Notifications:** *TODO: Implement an email service (e.g., using Nodemailer with SendGrid, Mailgun, or SMTP) to send results and suggestions.*
*   **Improvement Suggestions:** Integrated into quiz submission and retry responses.
*   **Caching Layer (Redis):** *TODO: Implement Redis caching for quiz data to reduce latency. This would involve:
    *   Adding `ioredis` or `redis` npm package.
    *   Setting up a Redis client.
    *   Modifying service functions (e.g., `getQuizById`, potentially `getQuizHistory` for common queries) to check cache first, and if not found, fetch from DB and store in cache.*
